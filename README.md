## :house Background <a name="background"></a>

Welcome to the Seattle Washington Housing Market Analysis project, where we dive deep into the real estate dynamics of one of the Pacific Northwest's most exciting cities. This repository is dedicated to an in-depth exploration of the housing market trends spanning the years 2018 to 2022 in the bustling urban landscape of Seattle. Powered by the combined prowess of PostgreSQL and a Python Flask application, our project presents an interactive dashboard that offers an insightful overview of the housing market's evolution during this significant timeframe.

We completed a comprehensive analysis and a visualization dashboard using a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a SQL database plotly, leaflet, D3 and charts.js. This project seeks to provide valuable insights in understanding Seattle's real estate dynamics.

In addition to dissecting historical trends, we've developed a cutting-edge machine learning model aimed at forecasting housing prices in the Seattle area. Leveraging the power of Random Forest and Linear Regression algorithms, we've trained a robust predictive model that takes into account a multitude of factors affecting housing prices. By incorporating data on property attributes, location details, economic indicators, and more, our model serves as a powerful tool for prospective buyers, sellers, and investors looking to make informed decisions in the complex Seattle real estate landscape.

# :house Final Production Database
Uploaded the CSV data files into a Postgres database a relational database management system.

## :house Data Sources <a name="data"></a>
Data for this dataset was pulled from a kaggle csv. All data collected and used in this analysis is intended for educational purposes only.

1. seattle_sales_all_data.csv (From kaggle)
2. seattle_sales.csv (cleaned up kaggle csv of only seattle from 2018-2022)

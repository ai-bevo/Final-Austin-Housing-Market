## üè† Background <a name="background"></a>

Welcome to the Seattle Washington Housing Market Analysis project, where we dive deep into the real estate dynamics of one of the Pacific Northwest's most exciting cities. This repository is dedicated to an in-depth exploration of the housing market trends spanning the years 2018 to 2022 in the bustling urban landscape of Seattle. Powered by the combined prowess of PostgreSQL and a Python Flask application, our project presents an interactive dashboard that offers an insightful overview of the housing market's evolution during this significant timeframe.

We completed a comprehensive analysis and a visualization dashboard using a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a SQL database plotly, leaflet, D3 and charts.js. This project seeks to provide valuable insights in understanding Seattle's real estate dynamics.

In addition to dissecting historical trends, we've developed a machine learning model aimed at forecasting housing prices in the Seattle area. Leveraging the power of Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithms, we've trained a robust predictive model that takes into account a multitude of factors affecting housing prices. By incorporating data on property attributes, location details, economic indicators, and more, our model serves as a powerful tool for prospective buyers, sellers, and investors looking to make informed decisions in the complex Seattle real estate landscape.

## üè† Findings and Conclusions <a name="findings"></a>
The following findings and conclusions from the analysis are as follows:

The Seattle housing market, like many tech hubs, has seen a large increase in housing values in recent years. Our analysis focused on single family homes in the Seattle area from 2018 through 2022. All of the single family homes are definded by the zoning regulations within Seattle. Over the five year span the median home price for single family homes saw an increase of approximatley 31%. In dollars that represents an increase of a median home price of $800,000 in 2018 to a median price of $1,050,000 in 2022, which is an increase of $250,000.

</p>

Using the data from the kaggle dataset we were able to create a machine learning model that predicts the price of a home based on the features of the home. The model was trained using the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm. The model was trained using 33 different features from our dataset. Some of those features included the following - living sqft , lot sqft, latitude, longitude, year built, total bed rooms, total bathrooms, water front, zipcode as well as several more factors. 

While training the model we went through several different regressions to generate the most accurate predictions we could. We found that we had the most accuracy by teaching the model with data from 2020-2022. The housing prices over this period displayed a more consistent increase in home prices over this period and generated a better fit or R^2 value from our model. Looking over the entire dataset from 2018-2022 the best R^2 value we were able to generate was approximatley 70%. By only analysing the data from 2020 - 2022 the model was able to generate an R^2 value of 80%.

### Performing Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a machine learning model for King County house data. 

## Background Information:
	
King county is a region in the state of Washington, USA, and it‚Äôs known for including the city of Seattle. EDA involves analyzing and summarizing the data to gain insights, while machine learning modeling involves creating predictive models using algorithms. Here‚Äôs a general outline of the process that was followed.

When it comes to selling houses, certain fundamental determinants play a vital role in influencing potential buyers. Key factors include the property's land size and the dimensions of the house itself. If you've ever explored house prices online, you're likely familiar with the importance of accurately gauging a property's value. Overpricing a home can deter potential buyers, significantly diminishing the likelihood of a successful sale. Conversely, underpricing a home might lead to missed opportunities for maximizing profits.

## Problem Statement:

   Conducting a thorough analysis of a property is essential prior to buying or selling. This analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of housing values in King County, along with analyzing various factors that have an impact on house prices within the region. By leveraging advanced machine learning modeling techniques, it becomes possible to generate precise and dependable predictions regarding market prices. These predictions are based on a holistic understanding of the dynamics that govern the real estate market in King County.

## Objectives:
   After our EDA, our mission is to construct a robust machine learning model. This model will serve as an important tool for predicting house prices, leveraging the insights gathered from our data exploration by bringing together domain knowledge and advanced computational techniques to create a cohesive and comprehensive approach for predicting house prices.

## Problems Encountered:

   In our project, we initially employed two regression models: linear regression and random forest, to predict sales prices. However, upon analyzing      the results on the entire dataset, we observed that the R-squared values, which indicate the goodness of fit of the models, were not satisfactory.
 
![image](https://github.com/ai-bevo/Final-Project-Austin-Housing-Market/assets/125619215/bbb6670f-9681-4af1-a876-d9aaaf2ec642)

  To improve our models' performance, we decided to work with subsets of the data. We divided the dataset into two subsets: 
   
   - containing sales prices greater than or equal to 1 million, and 
   -	The other contains sales prices less than 1 million.

  With these subsets, we re-ran the linear regression and random forest models separately. Surprisingly, the results for both subsets showed an increase in the R-squared values, indicating a better fit for our models. Encouraged by this improvement, we proceeded to perform a correlation analysis on the features in each subset.

(Mention the model used)

  Thinking that dropping some columns with low correlation could further enhance the model's performance, we began removing certain columns from the subsets. However, during this process, we observed a decrease in the R-squared values. This unexpected outcome signaled that removing these features had a significant and negatively impacted the models' predictive power.

  Realizing that our initial correlation-based feature removal was counterproductive, we promptly reverted the changes and restored the original subsets. This corrective action successfully brought the R-squared values back to their improved state.

This experience taught us the importance of cautious feature selection and highlighted that while correlation analysis can guide feature removal, it's crucial to consider the broader impact on model performance. It reinforced the idea that model optimization is a dynamic process, requiring a balance between feature manipulation and maintaining the integrity of the predictive power achieved through the initial subset approach.
